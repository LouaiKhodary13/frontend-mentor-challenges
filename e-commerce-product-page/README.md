## Context and Reducer:

Context Creation and Reducer Implementation
Context: The AppContext is created using createContext() to maintain global state accessible by multiple components.

Reducer: The reducer function specifies how the state should change based on dispatched actions. Actions like toggling the cart, incrementing/decrementing items, and calculating totals are handled here.

AppProvider: The AppProvider component wraps the entire application and provides the application state and actions to all components within its scope. It uses the useReducer hook to manage state transitions.

useGlobalContext: This custom hook useGlobalContext allows components to consume the context and access state values and actions.
